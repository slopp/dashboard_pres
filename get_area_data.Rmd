This R Markdown document runs on a scheduled basis to update the single_area_dashboard_shiny and final_dashboard. The R Markdown document generates a file, area.rds, containing the daily area usage statistics.

One benefit of having a scheduled Rmd instead of a scheduled .R file is a self-documenting log of the scheduled job!

Document run at: `r Sys.time()`.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
source("utils.R")
areas <- getKnownAreas()
resorts <- areas$resorts
area <- lapply(resorts, getAreaData)
saveRDS(area, file = "/tmp_shared/area.rds")
```
